# GenVal

A common way to check if molecules generated by generative models is to find out if the scaffolds exist in chemical databases such as ChEMBL and SureChEMBL.

GenVal implements [molbloom](https://github.com/whitead/molbloom) filters for both ChEMBL and SureChEMBL scaffolds and quickly assesses if the molecule's scaffold is found in the databases (with an error rate of 0.000025)


```python
from genval import GenVal, databases

print(databases)

gv = GenVal("chembl_scaffold")
gv.validate("c1ccccc1")
```
